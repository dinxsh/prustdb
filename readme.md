### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p2p_key_db.git
   cd p2p_key_db
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## 🔧 Usage

1. Start a node:
   ```
   cargo run --release -- --port 8000
   ```

2. Connect to an existing network:
   ```
   cargo run --release -- --port 8001 --peer 127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

3. Use the API to interact with the database:
   ```rust
   // Example code to be added
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our P2P Key-Value Database is built on a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture, similar to Kademlia. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Node Identification**: Each node in the network is assigned a unique ID in the same address space as the keys.

2. **Key-Value Storage**: Data is stored as key-value pairs, distributed across the network based on the proximity of the key to node IDs.

3. **Routing**: Nodes maintain a routing table of known peers, organized into k-buckets based on the XOR distance between node IDs.

4. **Lookup Protocol**: To find a key, nodes perform iterative lookups, querying progressively closer nodes until the key is found or the closest nodes are reached.

5. **Data Replication**: To ensure data availability and fault tolerance, key-value pairs are replicated across multiple nodes.

6. **Network Joining**: New nodes join the network by bootstrapping through a known peer, then performing lookups for their own ID to populate their routing table.

7. **Load Balancing**: The DHT naturally distributes data and lookup load across the network, with optional additional balancing mechanisms.

8. **Consistency**: We implement eventual consistency with configurable parameters for replication frequency and conflict resolution.

This architecture provides a scalable, resilient, and efficient foundation for our P2P key-value database, enabling fast lookups and updates in a decentralized environment.
