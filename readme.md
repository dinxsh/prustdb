## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- OpenSSL development libraries (for cryptography support)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p2p_key_db.git
   cd p2p_key_db
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
   ```
   cargo test
   ```

## üîß Usage

1. Start a node:
   ```
   cargo run --release -- --port 8000 --data-dir /path/to/data
   ```

2. Connect to an existing network:
   ```
   cargo run --release -- --port 8001 --peer 127.0.0.1:8000 --data-dir /path/to/data
   ```

3. Use the API to interact with the database:
   ```rust
   use prustdb_client::Client;

   async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
       let client = Client::connect("127.0.0.1:8000").await?;
       
       // Set a value
       client.set("key", "value").await?;
       
       // Get a value
       let value = client.get("key").await?;
       println!("Value: {:?}", value);

       Ok(())
   }
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our P2P Key-Value Database is built on a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture, similar to Kademlia. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Node Identification**: Each node in the network is assigned a unique ID using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

2. **Key-Value Storage**: Data is stored as key-value pairs, distributed across the network based on the proximity of the key to node IDs.

3. **Routing**: Nodes maintain a routing table of known peers, organized into k-buckets based on the XOR distance between node IDs.

4. **Lookup Protocol**: To find a key, nodes perform iterative lookups, querying progressively closer nodes until the key is found or the closest nodes are reached.

5. **Data Replication**: To ensure data availability and fault tolerance, key-value pairs are replicated across multiple nodes using a configurable replication factor.

6. **Network Joining**: New nodes join the network by bootstrapping through a known peer, then performing lookups for their own ID to populate their routing table.

7. **Load Balancing**: The DHT naturally distributes data and lookup load across the network, with additional active balancing mechanisms for hotspots.

8. **Consistency**: We implement tunable consistency levels, from eventual consistency to strong consistency, allowing users to choose the appropriate trade-off between performance and consistency for their use case.

9. **Caching**: An intelligent caching layer improves read performance for frequently accessed data.

10. **Compression**: Data is compressed before storage and transmission to reduce storage requirements and network usage.

## üöÄ Performance

PrustDB is designed for high performance:

- Asynchronous I/O for efficient resource utilization
- Custom memory allocator for reduced memory fragmentation
- Bloom filters for rapid non-existence proofs
- Optimized data structures for fast lookups and insertions
- Benchmarking suite for continuous performance monitoring

## üîí Security

Security is a top priority for PrustDB:

- End-to-end encryption for all data transmissions
- Authentication and authorization for all nodes and clients
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Sandboxing of untrusted code execution
- Detailed security documentation and best practices
